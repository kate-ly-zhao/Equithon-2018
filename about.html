    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div class = "headers">

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <div class = "text">
            <p>Millions of girls are being denied an education across the globe. According to UNESCO, 31 million girls of primary school age aren't in school
                in addition to the 34 million adolescent girls. This lack of education has lifelong impacts. Around the world, two thirds of the 774 illiterate
                people in the world are women. </p>
            <p>By improving access to education, rates for early motherhood are lowered, reducing mother & infant mortality. Young women can find work for
                themselves and become more independent. As such, e're aiming to improve access to education for girls and women all around the world.</p>

        <h2>How We Started</h2>
        <div class = "text">
            <p>We came up with this idea at Equithon 2018 hosted at the University of Waterloo. Access to education and women empowerment are both topics
                our team is extremely passionate about, and we hope we can use this opportunity to make a difference. </p>
        </div>

        <h2>How Are We Planning On Doing This?</h2>
        <div class = "text">
            <p>We realize this is no easy task. Not only do we have to compile the necessary educational resources and find mentors, we also have to get
                this information out. This website will be our base, but we also have plans to eventually utilize radio/cellphone networks to broadcast
                podcasts and info sessions. Ideally, we will be able to create community hubs where girls and women can come together, support each other,
                and work towards achieving their goals.</p>
