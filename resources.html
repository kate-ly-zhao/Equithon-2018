    <h2>Knowledge, Podcasts, & Resources - Coming Soon!</h2>
    <p> This is where we intend to compile educational resources, our radio podcasts, and anything additional that will aid the girls in
        achieving their goals. Our intention is to have broad learning categories: Arts/Humanities, Engineering/Technology,
        Life Science/Medicine, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences/Management. Once an user creates a profile, they will be able to create a
        learning plan with achievable goals/milestones along the way. Along the way, they'll be assigned a mentor in their region that they
        can talk to or meet up with. </p>
    <p> One of the biggest challenges we face is creating the feedback loop where we provide the learning tools and our users tell us where
        we can improve. In a lot of the areas we are targeting, many lack access to Internet, but radio/cellphones are more widely available.
        To initially get this out there, we plan to start with radio podcasts with a number they can call/text to establish contact. </p>
