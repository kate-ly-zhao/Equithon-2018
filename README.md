THE ATHENA PROJECT
By Alison Luo, Kate Zhao, Mable Chuah, and Maggie Zhang

The focus of this project is to improve access to education for girls and women in developing countries. We developed a website meant to act as a source for learning resources in addition to building networks and communities where women can empower each other. This still has a long way to go, but addressing major issues such as this never has a quick solution, and we hope to take this further in the future.
